# EvenOrOdd
The EvenOrOdd project is a joke package. Coming in at a 1GB+ of the raw files it was never really for production

## System Requirements
To build I was on a system using: 
- Intel Core I3 1005G1
- 8GB DDR4 RAM
- Python 3.11
- Windows 11 Home
- Did i mention it was a **LAPTOP**

### What about running it?
I didn't have enough memory for it to run
Sooooo let me know what rig you have if it works :)


## Usage
Below are the 2 importable functions

### odd_or_even
`odd_or_even()`
Checks if a number (0-2000000) is odd or even.
Usage:
`from EvenOrOdd.EOO import odd_or_even`
[IN]  `number = 1`
[IN]  `print(odd_or_even(number))`
[OUT] Odd

### Build
`Build()` creates your own version of the source. Can take from 1-4 hours.
Usage:
`from EvenOrOdd.build import Build`
`filepath = '/this/is/a/file/path/eoo_source.py'`   -- This must end in a .py file, existing or not
`Build(filepath)`

## Yeah thats it
Thank you for supporting my world record breaking package.
